For instance, HKUST-1 has been converted to MIL-100 by the immersion of the former in a FeCl3·6H2O solution for several hours at room temperature.26 This is a clear example of a facile and mild transmetalation methodology to obtain MIL-100, which is conventionally produced by using harsh synthetic conditions (hydrofluoric acid, 150 °C, 6 days).26 Another stimulating example is given by the transformation of the bio-MOF-1 to a Ag-based MOF by exposing the former to a silver nitrate solution.27 The transformed Ag-MOF displayed an\n",

The resulting open metal sites reduce the Young’s modulus, as measured with tip force microscopy and supported by theoretical modelling, but also open the door for defect engineering to tune the adsorption and catalytic performance of ZIF-8.  INTRODUCTION At the nanoscale, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) crystals feature miscellaneous shapes and sizes. Their diversity originates in their vast physical and chemical properties, paving the way for applications in sensing technologies, drug delivery, gas capture, or catalysis, among others.1-5 This multifunctionality emerges not simply because metal-organic frameworks are per se hybrid materials, built from metal clusters and organic linkers with a boundless number of possible combinations, but mostly because of their exceptional porosity, which sparks the adsorption, encapsulation or release of versatile guest molecules.6, 7 The power of engineering MOFs for application is, therefore, ascribed solely to the meticulous control of the framework properties and its interactions, which essentially originates in the material synthesis.7 For instance, the zeolitic imidazole framework ZIF-8, one of the most well-studied frameworks due to its stability and ease of synthesis, is obtained by combining zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2･6H2O) and 2-methylimidazole (mIm) ligands.8 The material is then formed by\u001b[0m\n",
